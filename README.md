# ABOUT THE PROJECT
## INTRODUCTION

```
Web3 and Blockchain is bringing with us brilliant technologies we can work with to improve 
a lot in our surroundings one of which is Non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Bokee is built on ethereum and utilizes the capabilities of the ERC-721 (NFTs) to manage the ownership of books.

```

## PROBLEM 
```
There have been a claim from the major publishing companies about the fall of book sellings just 
after the initial selling. Just to realize many people (students )
 prefer to buy secondhand books than new ones it might be due to cost, availability or any other reason.

```

```
Individual authors and publishing companies  are looking for the ways to increase 
their earnings while protecting their copyrights as I participate in these digital eras.
```
 
 ## SOLUTION
 ```
 Solution is to create Bookee the platform that
list and sell books as NFTs to readers.
Bookee provide authors with the chance to
collect revenue on the selling and reselling
of the copies after being.
